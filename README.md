# Instagram catalog posts

Small Streamlit app for an online clothing shop. Put a dress photo in a folder, press **Generate image**, and an OpenAI-compatible API returns a catalog photo of that outfit on a fashion mannequin. **Generate text** writes the listing copy. The general prompts are saved in `prompts/`, and your own notes are added for that run only.

The caption template uses the placeholders `SHOP_NAME`, `SHOP_ADDRESS`, and `SHOP_TAGLINE`. Put your own shop details there. API keys stay in `.env`, and outfit photos stay in `data/`. Neither is part of this repository. The Python package is `cloth_store`.

## Setup

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
```

Put the API keys in `.env`. The image call stays on an OpenAI-compatible server. Captions use DeepSeek:

```bash
API_KEY=sk-...
API_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1
IMAGE_MODEL=gpt-image-1-mini
```

In the sidebar, pick another OpenAI image model when needed: `gpt-image-1`, `gpt-image-1.5`, `gpt-image-2`, or `chatgpt-image-latest`. The stronger models follow the suit photos more closely and cost more. Captions still use DeepSeek:

```bash
TEXT_API_KEY=sk-...
TEXT_API_BASE_URL=https://api.deepseek.com
TEXT_MODEL=deepseek-flash
```

The same fields are in the sidebar, so you can switch servers without editing code.

## Run

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Put JPG, PNG, or WEBP dress photos in `data/images/`, or type another folder path in the sidebar. Select up to 10 photos of the same outfit, enter the suit code, then press **Generate image** or **Generate text**.

**Generate image** sends those photos in one call and saves one portrait, `instaimage-<code>.png`, at 1080×1350 (4:5) for Instagram. **Generate text** is a separate call. It sends the same photos to DeepSeek with the text prompt and writes one caption, which can also be reused on Facebook. Both files land in `data/output/`.

## Tests

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pytest
```
